#Stereo_cam and object recognition

These are small demos about using stereo cameras and object recognition

stereo_calib and stereo_match are from OpenCV sample cpp, I changed a bit about imread and files locations.

There is "Features2D + Homography to find a known object" in OpenCV tutorials, I tried to use it to find the object in webcam.
